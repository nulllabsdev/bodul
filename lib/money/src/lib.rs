//! # money
//!
//! Exact, currency-aware money value type for USD, EUR, CAD, and AUD.
//!
//! **This is the Phase 1 _skeleton_.** Every public item below has its inputs and
//! outputs (types and signatures) fixed, but every function body is `todo!()`.
//! The crate compiles and exposes the contract; it implements no behaviour yet.
//!
//! See the specs under `docs/`:
//! - `TS001_money-type.md` — authoritative behaviour (governs on any conflict).
//! - `IS001_phase1-skeleton.md` — this skeleton's contract and scope.
//! - `BR001_initial-business-requirements.md` — business context.
//!
//! Amounts are stored as a signed integer count of **minor units** (cents); no
//! floating point ever touches an amount (TS001 §2.1, INV-2).
