# EDR-0001: Using Linear for Issue Tracking

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Driver:** @miro
* **Approver:** @miro
* **Date:** 2026-01-12
* **Area:** Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a way to track issues, tasks, and bugs for the project. Historically, we might have used various tools, but we need a standardized, efficient, and publicly accessible way to manage our work.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for a clean, fast user interface.
* Requirement for public accessibility (needed for transparency).
* Integration capabilities with other tools like GitHub, Claude Code, Copilot and Codex
* Ease of use for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Considered Options

1. **GitHub Issues**: Integrated with our source code, but we might be separating repositories in the future which would make a big mess.
2. **Linear**: High performance, great UX, and purpose-built for modern software teams.
3. **Jira**: Too heavy and slow for agile development.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Linear**, seems as good enough for our needs.
