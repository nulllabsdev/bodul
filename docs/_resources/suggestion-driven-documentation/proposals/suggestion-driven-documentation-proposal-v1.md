Instead of making documentation changes on the fly during a pull request review,
ask LLM reviewers to write each actionable suggestion down in a suggestion
document. Review those documents afterward, decide which suggestions to
implement, and keep them as the record of what was proposed, completed, refused,
or deferred.

The default is one suggestion per document. A single document may contain
multiple suggestions only for small editorial-only batches such as typos,
formatting fixes, or similar non-behavioral wording changes. Batches must be
atomic: every item in a batch shares one `Priority`, `Decision`, and
`Implementation reference`. If review would give items in a batch different
decisions, split the mixed-decision batch into separate suggestion documents so
each decision is recorded accurately.

Store suggestions in `docs/_resources/{document-name}/suggestions/`. The
resource root is the repository's `docs/_resources/` directory; all suggestion
and proposal folders live underneath it.

`{document-name}` is a collision-resistant key derived from the target file's
path relative to `docs/`: drop the file extension and replace each `/` with `-`,
then apply SEO-style slug rules (lowercase, ASCII, words separated by single
hyphens). For example:

- `docs/contracts.md` → `contracts`
- `docs/api/contracts.md` → `api-contracts`
- `docs/legal/contracts.md` → `legal-contracts`

The last two files share the basename `contracts.md` but resolve to distinct
keys, so their suggestion folders never collide.

Use the following filename format:

`S{number}_{title}_{tool-model-effort}.md`

Example: `S001_improve-heading-clarity_claude-sonnet-4-6-high.md`

- `number` must be sequential and zero-padded to three digits: `001`, `002`,
  `003`, and so on.
- Suggestion numbers are tracked per target file suggestion folder. For example,
  suggestions for `docs/contracts.md` go into
  `docs/_resources/contracts/suggestions/`.
- Suggestion numbers are never reused within the same target file suggestion
  folder. Each new suggestion gets the next available number in that folder, and
  gaps from refused or removed suggestions are acceptable.
- `title` must be a short lowercase kebab-case summary, for example
  `improve-heading-clarity`.
- `tool-model-effort` must be a lowercase hyphenated identifier for the
  authoring tool, model, and effort level, for example
  `claude-sonnet-4-6-high` or `codex-gpt-5-medium`.

Each suggestion document should use this structure:

```md
# S012 - Improve heading clarity

| Field                    | Value                                |

| Priority                 | medium                               |
| File                     | `docs/example.md`                    |
| Decision                 | pending                              |
| Implementation reference |                                      |

## Issue
Briefly describe the problem being pointed out.

## Suggestion
Describe the proposed change clearly and concretely.

## Feedback
Reviewer notes about the decision, especially for refused or deferred
suggestions.
```

- `Priority` records importance, such as `low`, `medium`, or `high`.
- `File` records the original file being reviewed, not the proposal copy.
- `Decision` records the current state of the suggestion: `pending`, `accepted`,
  `completed`, `refused`, or `deferred`. `completed` means the change has been
  applied to the original target file, not merely to a proposal copy. A
  suggestion that has been applied to a proposal but whose proposal has not yet
  been promoted to the original file stays `accepted`.
- `Implementation reference` records the proposal artifact where the accepted
  suggestion was applied, such as
  `docs/_resources/{document-name}/proposals/{document-name}-proposal-v1.md`.
- `Created at` records when the suggestion was written.
- `Author` records who created the suggestion. For tools, include the tool name,
  model, and effort level.
- `Reviewer` records who reviewed the suggestion. Leave it blank while
  `Decision` is `pending`. Populate it when `Decision` becomes `accepted`,
  `completed`, `refused`, or `deferred`.
- `Feedback` is an optional reviewer-owned section. Use it to record decision
  rationale, especially when a suggestion is `refused` or `deferred`.
- `INDEX.md` links to suggestion documents for navigation. Suggestion documents
  remain the source of truth for their own `Decision`, `Reviewer`, and
  `Implementation reference`. See
  [`documentation-structure.md`](documentation-structure.md) for the resource
  index structure.

The engineering director is the human authority for questions that arise while
applying accepted suggestions.

## Creating suggestions

When an LLM tool is given a file to review:

1. Review the target document and write suggestions into
   `docs/_resources/{document-name}/suggestions/`.
2. Commit the suggestion documents.

## Reviewing suggestions

Before applying suggestions, a reviewer:

1. Reads each suggestion with `Decision` set to `pending`.
2. Sets `Decision` to `accepted`, `refused`, or `deferred`.
3. Populates `Reviewer`.
4. Writes `Feedback` when the decision needs rationale.
5. Updates `docs/_resources/{document-name}/INDEX.md` so it links to the
   suggestion document without duplicating its status fields.
6. Leaves `Implementation reference` blank until an accepted suggestion is
   applied to a proposal artifact.

Only accepted suggestions move into the applying workflow.

## Applying suggestions

1. Create a copy in `docs/_resources/{document-name}/proposals/` named
   `{document-name}-proposal-v{number}.{extension}`. Version numbers start at
   `1`. If proposal versions already exist for that file, use the next number
   after the highest existing version.
2. Commit the proposal copy as-is.
3. Read all suggestion documents with `Decision` set to `accepted`.
4. If there are any questions for the engineering director, ask them.
5. For each accepted suggestion, apply the change to the proposal copy and set
   `Implementation reference` to the proposal artifact. Leave `Decision` as
   `accepted`; the suggestion is not `completed` until the change reaches the
   original file.
6. Once every accepted suggestion targeting a proposal has been resolved, copy
   the proposal over the original file, update
   `docs/_resources/{document-name}/INDEX.md`, then set `Decision` to
   `completed` for each suggestion that was applied.
